        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>A design system can be very complex and specific. Just look to <a href="https://material.io"
            target="blank">material.io</a> for an example of a professional and comprehensive design system.</p>
        <p>While it is possible to create, or work off of a design system like this. You can also create a simpler
          design system to guide your design process. This approach works well with css frameworks such as <a
            href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">bootstrap</a> or <a href="https://" tailwindcss.com"
            target="_blank">tailwind</a>.</p>

        <h3>Creating a design library</h3>
        <p>You can create a design library in figma and penpot. This is really useful for planning the look and feel of
          a website.</p>
        <p>A design library can be shared with other designers and developers. It can also be used to export css styles.
        </p>
        <!--TODO: Write out steps to set up a design library-->

        <h3>Setting up a color palette</h3>
        <p>Color palletes are very easy to make in both figma and penpot</p>
        <p>In figma, there is a <strong>+</strong> next to the color tool in the right panel. You can select this and
          add to styles.</p>
        <p>In penpot, you will do most of this in the assets tab.</p>
        <p>When creating your colors, give them names and add the hex value to that name for ease of use later</p>
      </section>

        <h3>Creating a Typography system</h3>
        <img src="assets/images/lg/design-pencils.webp" alt="Design Pencils">
        <p>Add fonts to a typographic system</p>
        <p>use a web oriented naming convention and set up the following styles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>title: h1, h2, p, button, etc</li>
          <li>font family</li>
          <li>fontweight</li>
          <li>font size</li>
          <li>char spacing</li>
          <li>line height</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on your work flow, you may want to add other content to the title.</p>
        <div>
          <h4>Important</h4>
          <p>You can group your font styles in both figma and penpot</p>
          <p>To do this, write: <br>/group-title font-name</p>
          <p>I use /header and /content as two categories when I do this</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>I hope that these pointers are useful to you. Both penpot and figma are great tools for doing UI design work.
          Figma has a few extra features and premade libraries that penpot does not yet support, but the important
          things can be done in both.</p>
